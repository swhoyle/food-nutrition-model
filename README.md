# Open Food Nutrition Score Model

**Abstract:**

The objective of this project is to develop a supervised machine learning model for predicting the Nutri-Score (Aâ€“E), a key indicator of nutritional quality, for a wide range of food products. Utilizing the comprehensive Open Food Facts dataset, which contains detailed nutritional and ingredient information for more than four million products worldwide, the study performs data preprocessing and feature engineering by extracting attributes from three primary domains: nutrient values, ingredient composition, and additive content. These processed features will train classification algorithms designed to accurately assign Nutri-Scores to new or unlabeled products. By automating the nutritional assessment process, the project seeks not only to demonstrate the potential of data-driven approaches in food health evaluation but also to provide deeper insights into the relative importance of various nutritional and compositional factors that influence Nutri-Score classification. The findings of this study have the potential to support consumers, manufacturers, and public health stakeholders in making more informed decisions about food quality and nutritional healthfulness.
